While the TransLoc app is extremely useful, it’s\n            not the most ideal way to get bus information for people waiting at\n            bus stops. For those carrying things in their hands, wearing gloves,\n            or engaged in meaningful conversations or other activities, checking\n            the bus information on their phones could be quite inconvenient.\n            There are also a lot of people, especially campus visitors, who\n            don’t have the TransLoc app installed on their phones.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Wanting to make it more convenient for people to get bus information\n            and make the information available to everyone, I decided to build a\n            WiFi-connected, solar-powered kiosk that shows real-time bus\n            information that can potentially be installed at the Duke Chapel bus\n            stop, the busiest bus stop at Duke.

As the team\n            member with the most experience in electrical design, I was\n            responsible for creating the proof of concept, the selection and\n            testing of most of the electrical components, and the PCB design.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            All the design files and source code for this project are available\n            <a\n              href=\"https://github.com/Jianan-Li/Bus-Stop-Kiosk\"\n              target=\"_blank\"\n              rel=\"noreferrer\"\n              >here</a\n            >.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"project-section\">\n          <div class=\"project-section-title\">PROOF OF CONCEPT</div>\n          <img\n            :src=\"require('@/assets/bus-stop-kiosk/1.jpg')\"\n            alt=\"bus-stop-kiosk-1\"\n            class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            To confirm that it’s possible to get real-time bus information using\n            a WiFi module, I built a proof of concept using an Electric Imp, an\n            Atmega328P, a 4x20 LCD, and a few other components.

However, we soon discovered that the only flip-dot display\n            available for purchase was about 15 times more expensive than an LED\n            matrix of the same size. Due to our limited budget, we opted for the\n            latter. We purchased four 32x16 LED matrices on eBay, and connected\n            them together to form a 64x32 LED matrix display.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"project-section\">\n          <div class=\"project-section-title\">3D PRINTED BACKPLATE</div>\n          <img\n            :src=\"require('@/assets/bus-stop-kiosk/3.jpg')\"\n            alt=\"bus-stop-kiosk-3\"\n            class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            We designed a backplate that the four LED matrices can be mounted\n            on, and printed it on a Gigabot 3D printer.

The Transloc API provides bus\n            locations in longitude and latitude, from which the distances\n            between the bus and the two nearest bus stops can be calculated.

It didn't take long\n            before I realized this setup was far from ideal. First, the\n            off-the-shelf solar charge controller had a relatively high\n            quiescent current (approximately 13mA), making it more difficult for\n            the system to be self-sufficient. Second, the solar charge\n            controller did not allow the power generated from the solar panel to\n            be monitored remotely.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"project-section\">\n          <div class=\"project-section-title\">PCB REV. 2</div>\n          <img\n            :src=\"require('@/assets/bus-stop-kiosk/8.jpg')\"\n            alt=\"bus-stop-kiosk-8\"\n            class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            Because of the two issues with the solar charge controller, I\n            decided to design my own solar charger circuit for PCB Rev. 2. I\n            created a design using the LT3652 battery charger IC. I replaced the\n            fuse box with SMD fuses, and added two more INA226 current sensors\n            to monitor the power generated by the solar panel and the power\n            going into the battery. I also added a terminal block for connecting\n            the solar panel, and another for the LED strip.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"project-section\">\n          <div class=\"project-section-title\">THE PCB REV. 2 SETUP</div>\n          <img\n            :src=\"require('@/assets/bus-stop-kiosk/9.jpg')\"\n            alt=\"bus-stop-kiosk-9\"\n            class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            The quiescent current of the solar charger circuit I designed was\n            significantly lower than that of the off-the-shelf solar charge\n            controller (&lt;100μA vs 13mA). Since both the battery and the solar\n            panel plugged directly into the PCB, the wiring became a lot\n            simpler. And with the additional current sensors, both the power\n            generation and consumption of the system could be remotely monitored\n            in the Electric Imp IDE.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"project-section\">\n          <div class=\"project-section-title\">PCB REV. 2 BLOCK DIAGRAM</div>\n          <img\n            :src=\"require('@/assets/bus-stop-kiosk/10.png')\"\n            alt=\"bus-stop-kiosk-10\"\n            class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            This block diagram shows how both on-board and off-board components\n            are powered, and how they communicate with each other.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"project-section\">\n          <div class=\"project-section-title\">PUTTING THINGS TOGETHER</div>\n          <img\n            :src=\"require('@/assets/bus-stop-kiosk/11.jpg')\"\n            alt=\"bus-stop-kiosk-11\"\n            class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n          />\n          <img\n            :src=\"require('@/assets/bus-stop-kiosk/12.jpg')\"\n            alt=\"bus-stop-kiosk-12\"\n            class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            We constructed a stand for things to be mounted on.

We\n            positioned the bus location map right below the LED matrix display,\n            and bolted the enclosure to the aluminum pole. In this picture,\n            locations of the C1 and C4 buses are displayed on the map. To avoid\n            any confusion, we used the same colors as the ones in the TransLoc\n            app to represent the four bus routes.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"project-section\">\n          <div class=\"project-section-title\">FINAL PROJECT DEMO</div>\n          <img\n            :src=\"require('@/assets/bus-stop-kiosk/15.jpg')\"\n            alt=\"bus-stop-kiosk-15\"\n            class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n          />\n          <!-- <p>The final project demo took place twelve weeks after we started working on this project.

We removed the LED display and the bus location map from the stand, and mounted them to the frame of the bus stop shelter. The battery was stored in a metal box secured to the shelter frame, and the solar panel was mounted on top of the sloped roof, facing south.</p>\n        </div> -->\n\n        <!-- <ProjectNavigation next=\"pig-push-toy\"></ProjectNavigation> -->\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <!-- <SiteFooter /> -->\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n// @ is an alias to /src\n// import SiteHeader from \"@/components/SiteHeader.vue\";\n// import SiteFooter from \"@/components/SiteFooter.vue\";\n// import ProjectNavigation from \"@/components/ProjectNavigation.vue\";\n\nexport default {\n  name: \"BusStopKiosk\",\n  components: {\n    // SiteHeader,\n    // SiteFooter,\n    // ProjectNavigation\n  },\n  mounted() {\n    this.$emit(\"mounted\");\n  }\n};\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n@import \"../styles/projectPage.css\";\n</style>\n"],"sourceRoot":"src/components"}]}
