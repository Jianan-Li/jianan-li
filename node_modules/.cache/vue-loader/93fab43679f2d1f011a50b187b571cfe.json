After experimenting with different\n          angles for the handle, I decided on 20° due to its gentleness and\n          ease of carrying. I created a CAD model of the watering can in\n          Fusion 360. Then, instead of resorting to 3D printing, I decided to\n          make a silicone mold for my watering can and use slush casting to\n          produce the final physical model.\n        </p>\n        <img\n          :src=\"require('@/assets/watering-can/2.jpg')\"\n          alt=\"watering-can-2\"\n          class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n        />\n        <img\n          :src=\"require('@/assets/watering-can/3.jpg')\"\n          alt=\"watering-can-3\"\n          class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n        />\n        <img\n          :src=\"require('@/assets/watering-can/4.jpg')\"\n          alt=\"watering-can-4\"\n          class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n        />\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"project-section\">\n        <div class=\"project-section-title\">CNC CUTTING THE FOAM MASTER</div>\n        <p>\n          I imported the model into Rhino, and designed the master to be cut\n          out on a CNC router in high density polyurethane foam. The master\n          would later be used to create a brush-on silicone mold, so I added a\n          fence surrounding the design to limit the flow of the silicone. I\n          also added registration keys in the model so that the two halves of\n          the silicone mold would self-align.\n        </p>\n        <img\n          :src=\"require('@/assets/watering-can/5.png')\"\n          alt=\"watering-can-5\"\n          class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n        />\n        <p>\n          After the CNC cutting is completed, I noticed a few defects on the\n          master, which I fixed using some wood filler. I then carefully\n          sanded out all the scallops left by the 1/4\" ball end mill, and\n          sealed the entire top surface using Smooth-on SuperSeal.\n        </p>\n        <img\n          :src=\"require('@/assets/watering-can/6.jpg')\"\n          alt=\"watering-can-6\"\n          class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n        />\n        <img\n          :src=\"require('@/assets/watering-can/7.jpg')\"\n          alt=\"watering-can-7\"\n          class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n        />\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"project-section\">\n        <div class=\"project-section-title\">MOLD MAKING & SLUSH CASTING</div>\n        <p>\n          I used Smooth-On Rebound 25 for the brush-on silicone mold, and\n          Smooth-On Plasti‑Paste II for the mother mold. One important thing\n          when making the brush-on silicone mold is to make each layer a\n          different color from the previous one. This helps ensure uniform\n          thickness throughout the entire mold and prevent weak (thin) spots.\n        </p>\n        <img\n          :src=\"require('@/assets/watering-can/8.jpg')\"\n          alt=\"watering-can-8\"\n          class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n        />\n        <p>\n          After the silicone mold has cured and before making the mother mold,\n          I laser cut a 1/4\" MDF sheet and placed it flat on the foam master\n          right outside the fence for the silicone mold. This MDF piece would\n          later become part of the mother mold, and would allow the two halves\n          of the mother mold to be easily bolted together.\n        </p>\n        <img\n          :src=\"require('@/assets/watering-can/9.jpg')\"\n          alt=\"watering-can-9\"\n          class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n        />\n        <img\n          :src=\"require('@/assets/watering-can/10.jpg')\"\n          alt=\"watering-can-10\"\n          class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n        />\n        <img\n          :src=\"require('@/assets/watering-can/11.jpg')\"\n          alt=\"watering-can-11\"\n          class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n        />\n        <p>\n          For slush casting, I used Smooth-On Smooth-Cast 65D. In my first\n          attempt, I made the mistake of not calculating how much material I\n          need beforehand, and ended up with a watering can that weighed over\n          1 kilogram and was almost completely filled up. For the second\n          attempt, I calculated how much material I need based on the volume\n          information in Fusion 360, and achieved much better result.\n        </p>\n        <video\n          class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n          autoplay\n          loop\n          muted\n          playsinline\n        >\n          <source\n            :src=\"require('@/assets/watering-can/12.webm')\"\n            type=\"video/webm\"\n          />\n          <source\n            :src=\"require('@/assets/watering-can/12.mp4')\"\n            type=\"video/mp4\"\n          />\n        </video>\n      </div>\n\n      <div class=\"project-section\">\n        <div class=\"project-section-title\">FINISHED MODEL</div>\n        <img\n          :src=\"require('@/assets/watering-can/13.jpg')\"\n          alt=\"watering-can-13\"\n          class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n        />\n        <img\n          :src=\"require('@/assets/watering-can/14.jpg')\"\n          alt=\"watering-can-14\"\n          class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n        />\n        <img\n          :src=\"require('@/assets/watering-can/15.jpg')\"\n          alt=\"watering-can-15\"\n          class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n        />\n        <img\n          :src=\"require('@/assets/watering-can/16.jpg')\"\n          alt=\"watering-can-16\"\n          class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n        />\n      </div>\n\n      <!-- <ProjectNavigation next=\"letter-opener\"></ProjectNavigation> -->\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <!-- <SiteFooter /> -->\n</div>\n",null]}
