In order\n            to train myself to be spontaneous and not to overthink about all the\n            details, I enlisted the help of my friends to build this piano\n            within 24 hours at HackDuke 2013.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            As the team leader and the only ECE major on the team, I was\n            responsible for organizing brainstorming sessions to come up with\n            key system features, providing technical guidance to all team\n            members, and designing all the electrical circuits. In the end, we\n            successfully created a 25-key piano that functions as a wireless\n            MIDI controller. While playing the piano, you can use the remote to\n            easily shift up or down octaves, switch between different MIDI\n            instruments, and enter the tutorial mode where the piano teaches you\n            how to play songs by turning on the LED strips on the keys.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The video shows my friend Jason Kim and I playing a few different\n            songs on the piano. (I had to connect a power supply to the piano\n            when shooting the video because the LiPo batteries powering the\n            electronics in the box had just died.) Below are some pictures\n            showing a revision of the pressure plate design, the major\n            components of the system, and the communication scheme between these\n            components. The source code for this project is available here.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"project-section\">\n          <div class=\"project-section-title\">PRESSURE PLATE V1</div>\n          <img\n            :src=\"require('@/assets/floor-piano/1.jpg')\"\n            alt=\"floor-piano-1\"\n            class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            Two sheets of aluminum foil are each taped to a piece of cardboard,\n            and a strip of cardboard going around the edge is sandwiched in\n            between. It turned out that there are two major problems with this\n            design. First, the wrinkling of the aluminum foil allows the top and\n            bottom to short even without any force applied. Second, the strip of\n            cardboard sandwiched in the middle quickly becomes deformed after\n            just a few minutes of playing, also leading to a short.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"project-section\">\n          <div class=\"project-section-title\">PRESSURE PLATE V2</div>\n          <img\n            :src=\"require('@/assets/floor-piano/2.jpg')\"\n            alt=\"floor-piano-2\"\n            class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            In redesigning the pressure plate, we addressed the two major issues\n            with the previous version. To reduce the gap between the aluminum\n            foil and the cardboard that it's attached to, we glued each sheet of\n            aluminum foil to the cardboard. And to ensure the top and bottom\n            remain separated after extended period of playing, we replaced the\n            strip of cardboard sandwiched in the middle with four pieces of\n            polyurethane foam.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"project-section\">\n          <div class=\"project-section-title\">KEYBOARD ASSEMBLY</div>\n          <img\n            :src=\"require('@/assets/floor-piano/3.jpg')\"\n            alt=\"floor-piano-3\"\n            class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            We decided to assemble a total of 25 pressure plates, as a\n            two-octave range is sufficient for playing lots of different songs.\n            For visual appeal and the possibility of a tutorial mode, we taped a\n            short LED strip to each key. Since we wanted to be able to carry it\n            around easily, we split the keyboard into two halves - one with 12\n            keys and the other 13 - and taped together the keys in each half\n            with duct tape.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"project-section\">\n          <div class=\"project-section-title\">KEYBOARD CONTROL UNIT</div>\n          <img\n            :src=\"require('@/assets/floor-piano/4.jpg')\"\n            alt=\"floor-piano-4\"\n            class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            The keyboard control unit consists of an Arduino Mega, an XBee\n            module, 25 TIP120 Darlington Transistors, two strips of header pins,\n            and a few LiPo batteries. Each half of the keyboard is connected to\n            the corresponding header pins through a set of jumper wires. After\n            detecting a key press/release, the Arduino Mega sends the\n            information to the receiver through the XBee, and then turns on/off\n            the TIP120 that drives the LED strip on that key.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"project-section\">\n          <div class=\"project-section-title\">REMOTE CONTROL</div>\n          <img\n            :src=\"require('@/assets/floor-piano/5.jpg')\"\n            alt=\"floor-piano-5\"\n            class=\"project-process-pic card-no-hover\"\n          />\n          <p>\n            The remote control is built around an ATtiny85 microcontroller.
