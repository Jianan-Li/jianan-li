Every\\n          day, students rely on the bus arrival times and locations provided\\n          in the TransLoc app to either get to places on time or make changes\\n          to their schedules. While the TransLoc app is extremely useful, it’s\\n          not the most ideal way to get bus information for people waiting at\\n          bus stops. For those carrying things in their hands, wearing gloves,\\n          or engaged in meaningful conversations or other activities, checking\\n          the bus information on their phones could be quite inconvenient.\\n          There are also a lot of people, especially campus visitors, who\\n          don’t have the TransLoc app installed on their phones.\\n        \"\n        )\n      ]),\n      _c(\"p\", [\n        _vm._v(\n          \"\\n          Wanting to make it more convenient for people to get bus information\\n          and make the information available to everyone, I decided to build a\\n          WiFi-connected, solar-powered kiosk that shows real-time bus\\n          information that can potentially be installed at the Duke Chapel bus\\n          stop, the busiest bus stop at Duke.
